**Shortcuts** are entries in your libraries which allow you to run your installed apps. By default, they are defined in `~/.Phoenicis/shortcuts/`.
Every shortcut is described by several files:
* .description: Well, a description.
* .miniature: The image which is shown in your library.
* .shortcut: Contains information how the app has to be started (e.g. path to the executable)
